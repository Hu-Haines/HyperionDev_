# Hello! Welcome to My HyperionDev_ Coding Journal 🚀

In this repository, there are a collection of various projects and tasks, big and small. Each one was a step forward in my learning process and improvement.

## What's Inside? 🧐

### Python Basics
Since this is my 1st coding learning experience. There are mini-projects which contain the essentials of Python, from when I first learnt about them! 

### Themed Coding Projects
For some coding tasks, I have changed the theme to be more imaginative. However, this doesn't mean that the content is useless, as their core task still serves a practical purpose. 

### Oncoming Endevours 🚧
This is an ongoing project, so currently in Hyperiondev we have delved into data analysis, machine learning and NLP. Keep an eye out for any new commits during this time :) 

Excited for this to be my 1st coding and learning experience🌟

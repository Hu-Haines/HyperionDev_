# HyperionDev_
These are all my projects and tasks no matter how big or small. 

These are the ones which I believe contributed to improving.

It goes through projects and tasks that are Python basics, some of which are "fun" projects due to the theme of the variables.

I will be continuing to add topics that I have recently learnt like (data visualisation and machine learning models).

And I would also like to produce more larger projects, so stay tuned :)
